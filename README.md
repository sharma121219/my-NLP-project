# my-NLP-project
I build a chatbot in Dialogflow for a food delivery system. It will be an end-to-end project covering Dialogflow basics, building a backend in python and Fastapi, interactions with MySQL database, and much more. We will cover Dialogflow fundamentals such as intents, entities, contexts, etc.
